      <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        SayBon is a Ghanaian-owned and built language learning platform designed
        to make French education accessible, engaging, and practically usable worldwide.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform integrates structured international-standard language learning,
        original music-based education, affordable DELF exam preparation, and professional
        French–English translation services into one scalable ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        SayBon is not simply a language-learning application.
        It is a complete language ecosystem connecting learning, certification,
        engagement, and real-world language use.

      <h2>2. The Global Problem</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High cost of quality French education</li>
        <li>Over 80–90% learner dropout on traditional platforms</li>
        <li>Fragmented and expensive DELF exam preparation</li>
        <li>Weak transition from learning to real-world usage</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Language education remains fragmented across multiple platforms,
        reducing learner confidence and long-term success.
